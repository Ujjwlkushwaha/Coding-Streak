/*
    âœ… 2981. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I

        You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.

        A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.

        Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.

        A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

        Input: s = "aaaa"
        Output: 2

        Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "aaaa", "aaaa", and "aaaa".
        It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.

Example 2:

        Input: s = "abcdef"
        Output: -1

        Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.

Example 3:

        Input: s = "abcaba"
        Output: 1

        Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "abcaba", "abcaba", and "abcaba".
        It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.
